# Conscious Coherence Simulation Framework

Implements the hybrid ODE–Kuramoto ensemble and thermodynamic metrics described in  
*The Conscious Coherence Principle: Toward a Third Constant in Relativistic Physics* (Martinez, 2025).

## Overview
This repository contains the source code, sample data, and plotting routines used to generate the simulations and figures presented in the paper.  
It demonstrates how a bounded coherence scalar Φ₍c₎ modulates energetic efficiency while preserving conservation and Lorentz invariance.
