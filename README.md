# Conscious Coherence Simulation Framework

Computational framework implementing the hybrid ODE‚ÄìKuramoto simulations and coherence metrics described in  
*The Conscious Coherence Principle: Toward a Third Constant in Relativistic Physics* (Martinez, 2025).

## üß≠ Overview
This repository contains the complete simulation environment used to produce the results and figures in the paper.  
It models how a bounded coherence scalar Œ¶‚Ççc‚Çé(t) modulates energetic efficiency within coupled oscillator ensembles, preserving conservation and Lorentz invariance.

Core components include:
- **Hybrid ODE‚ÄìKuramoto model** for coherence dynamics  
- **Thermodynamic and informational metrics** (entropy, efficiency, phase alignment)  
- **Parameter sweeps and visualizations** used in the published results
